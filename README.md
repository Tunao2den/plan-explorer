##  Technical Implementation

### State Management
- React hooks for component-level state
- Optimized re-renders with useMemo and useCallback

### Data Processing
- Pure functions for filtering and sorting
- Client-side data manipulation for instant feedback
- Type-safe data transformations

### Type System
-  TypeScript definitions
- Strict typing for all data structures

## ️ Design Trade-Offs

### Current Implementation Choices
| Decision | Pros | Cons | Alternatives |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Static JSON Data** | Simple, fast, easy development | Not updatable, not scalable | API integration, databases |
| **Client-Side State** | No external dependencies, React-native | No persistence, hard to share state | Redux, Zustand, React Query |
| **Pure Functions** | Highly testable, predictable | Less flexible for complex operations | Class-based services |
| **Component Composition** | Reusable, testable components | More files, potential over-engineering | Monolithic components |
| **Client-Side Processing** | Instant UI updates, works offline | Not scalable for large datasets | Server-side processing |


## AI Assistance

### Primary AI Tool: Cursor IDE
- **Visual Design**: Design and implement CSS for intended styling
- **Components**: Boilerplate code generation for React components
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript assistance and best practices

- Rich metadata (nutritional breakdowns)

### Phase 3: API Integration 
- RESTful API development
- Real-time data synchronization
- Offline-first capabilities with sync

### Phase 4: User Authentication
- User registration and authentication
- Personal data isolation and security
- Profile management and preferences

### Phase 5: Recommendation Engine 
- Goal-based meal suggestions
- Nutritional optimization algorithms
- Dietary restriction handling

### Phase 6: AI-Powered Planning 
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Dynamic meal plan generation
- Integration with fitness trackers and health apps
